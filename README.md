> A grunt-django-compressor Django app for testing

This Django application is a simple demo to test the `grunt-django-compressor` plugin.

## Installing

1. Clone the repo
2. Run `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Install bower components with `bower install`
4. Install dependencies with `npm install` (grunt and grunt-django-compressor)

## Testing the plugin

Just run `grunt django_compressor` in the terminal and see how magic happens, the grunt_dajngo_compressor_versions.json file will be generated and it's excluded in the .gitignore for your testing purposes.

If you want to play with this plugin you can install more bower dependencies like Sugarjs or whatever you like, you can also create your own scripts and import them inside new templates or existent templates.
